# TypeScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey! This repository contains various examples, exercises, and projects as I explore and master TypeScript.

## 📚 What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
To work with this repository, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Install via `npm install -g typescript`)

## 🔧 Getting Started
Follow these steps to clone the repository and start working with TypeScript examples:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/typescript-journey.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd typescript-journey
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Compile and run TypeScript files:
    - To compile a TypeScript file to JavaScript:
        ```bash
        tsc filename.ts
        ```
    - To run a TypeScript file directly (using `ts-node`):
        ```bash
        npx ts-node filename.ts
        ```
